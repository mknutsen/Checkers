# CHECKERS
As a final project for my AI class, I worked with a small team on implementing the classic board game checkers in Java with Swing and developing an AI to play against. To pick the ideal move, an implementation of the minimax theorm was used to algorithmically minimize the worst case scenario. To allow the computer to manage the huge number of available moves, the alpha beta pruning technique was added. This technique prevents the computer from exploring movement options that will never be considered because the optimal move has already been discovered.
